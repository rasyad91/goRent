Introduction

E-commerce has been booming in the last few years, with the ease of purchasing online increasing. With an increase in purchasing, means an increase in waste production. Purchases are long term, but may be the only way to fill a short term need of the consumer. Purchasing sometimes can be quite expensive while renting can be cheaper. We aim to target a younger demographic as concepts such as thrifting and sustainability awareness are rising in popularity in this group. GoRent aims to introduce an alternative solution to providing users with a platform to rent products.
